# Overview of Data Repositories

In this video, we will provide an overview of the different types of repositories where your data might reside, such as databases, data warehouses, and big data stores. We will examine these in greater detail in further videos. Let's begin with databases.

## Databases

A **database** is a collection of data designed for input, storage, search and retrieval, and modification of data. A **Database Management System (DBMS)** is a set of programs that creates and maintains the database, allowing you to store, modify, and extract information using querying functions. For instance, a DBMS can retrieve data of customers who have been inactive for six months or more using a query function.

**Types of Databases:**

- **Relational Databases (RDBMS):** Organize data into tables with rows and columns, following a well-defined structure and schema. SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard querying language for these databases.
- **Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL):** Emerged to handle the volume, diversity, and speed of today's data, influenced by cloud computing, IoT, and social media. NoSQL databases store data in a schema-less or free-form fashion, making them suitable for processing big data.

## Data Warehouses

A **data warehouse** is a central repository that merges information from disparate sources and consolidates it through the **extract, transform, load (ETL)** process. The ETL process involves extracting data from different sources, transforming it into a clean and usable state, and loading it into the enterprise's data repository. Data warehouses support analytics and business intelligence.

**Related Concepts:**

- **Data Marts:** Subsets of data warehouses focused on specific business areas.
- **Data Lakes:** Store raw data in its native format until needed.

Traditionally, data warehouses and data marts have been relational, but with the emergence of NoSQL technologies and new data sources, non-relational data repositories are also used for data warehousing.

## Big Data Stores

**Big Data Stores** include distributed computational and storage infrastructure designed to store, scale, and process very large data sets. They help isolate data and make reporting and analytics more efficient and credible while also serving as a data archive.

## Summary

Data repositories, including databases, data warehouses, and big data stores, play a crucial role in organizing and managing data for business operations, reporting, and data analysis. Each type of repository serves different purposes and is chosen based on factors such as data type, structure, querying mechanisms, latency requirements, transaction speeds, and intended use of the data.

# Understanding Relational Databases

A **relational database** organizes data into tables where each table consists of rows (records) and columns (attributes). Tables can be linked based on common data, enabling complex queries and insights. Let's delve deeper into the specifics and advantages of relational databases.

## Structure and Functionality

- **Tables and Relationships:** Data in relational databases is structured into tables with predefined schemas. For instance, a customer table might include attributes like Company ID, Name, Address, and Phone, with each row representing a customer record. These tables can be related based on common fields, such as Customer ID, to link to transaction tables, which store details like Transaction Date and Amount.
- **SQL (Structured Query Language):** SQL is used to query relational databases. It facilitates operations like data retrieval, insertion, updating, and deletion. SQL's standardized syntax and powerful querying capabilities allow for efficient data processing and retrieval.
- **Data Integrity:** Relational databases enforce data integrity through constraints, ensuring data accuracy and consistency. Types and values of fields can be restricted, reducing anomalies and ensuring reliable data operations.
- **Scalability and Security:** Relational databases scale from small desktop systems to large cloud-based infrastructures. They offer robust security features, controlling access and ensuring compliance with data governance policies.

## Advantages of Relational Databases

- **Meaningful Information Retrieval:** By joining tables based on relationships, relational databases enable complex queries that yield valuable insights.
- **Flexibility:** SQL allows for dynamic changes like adding tables or modifying schema while the database is operational, without interrupting queries.
- **Reduced Redundancy:** Data redundancy is minimized; each piece of information is stored once, enhancing storage efficiency and consistency.
- **Backup and Recovery:** Relational databases offer straightforward backup and restore procedures, crucial for disaster recovery. Cloud-based solutions provide continuous data mirroring for rapid recovery.
- **ACID Compliance:** ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) ensure transactions are processed reliably, maintaining data accuracy despite failures.

## Use Cases

- **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing):** Ideal for high-speed transactional applications where frequent small updates and queries are performed, supporting multiple concurrent users.
- **Data Warehousing:** Optimized for OLAP (Online Analytical Processing), analyzing historical data for business intelligence and reporting.
- **IoT Solutions:** Suitable for IoT environments requiring rapid data ingestion and processing from edge devices, ensuring data integrity and reliability.

## Limitations

- **Semi-Structured and Unstructured Data:** Not well-suited for extensive analytics on semi-structured or unstructured data types.
- **Schema Rigidity:** Migration between relational databases requires identical schemas, which can be limiting when integrating diverse data sources.
- **Field Length Limits:** Constraints on field length can restrict the amount of data stored, requiring careful schema design.

Despite these limitations in handling diverse data types and evolving technologies like big data and IoT, relational databases remain pivotal for managing structured data effectively. Their standardized querying, data integrity features, and wide adoption make them indispensable in various industries for transactional and analytical purposes.
